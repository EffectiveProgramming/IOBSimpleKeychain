# IOBSimpleKeychain
===================
IOBSimpleKeychain makes it easier to use the iOS keychain how many of us do: as a generic bag to hold data in a secure manner with all the bells and whistles that iOS gives us with their SecureEnclave and other associated technologies.  Seriously, go read their [security white paper](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf).

Disclaimer: This *might* support OSX but it was developed for iOS use.  I have no interest in OSX development so I did not test it.

There are a lot of iOS keychain frameworks out there so why did I write this?  The existing frameworks didn't work like I wanted and I thought I could do better.  I also wanted to learn the Keychain Services APIs.

Pull requests are welcome.

Thanks to UICKeyChainStore for getting me interested in Keychain Services :^)
